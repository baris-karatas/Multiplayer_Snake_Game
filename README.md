# Multiplayer_Snake_Game
I created a multiplayer snake game that allows users to play snake game more than one player in a single map.

To do tihs project I used multi-thread library to create more smooth game and of course realtime play.

as in the picture we have two snake in one map. The players can control snakes both with "w,s,s,d" and "8,4,5,6" keys.
Temporary this control buttons is'nt the best convenience keys but it the game is playable right now.

we have score table upfront to show scores of players when they eat the food they gain 10 points.
